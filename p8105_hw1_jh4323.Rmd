## Problem 1

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
set.seed(1)

# create dataframe problem1_df
problem1_df <- tibble(
  vec_numeric = rnorm(10),
  vec_logical = vec_numeric > 0,
  vec_char = c("James", "Linda", "Jerry", "Jason", "Mary", 
               "Michael", "Sarah", "David", "Betty", "Joseph"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("poor", "fair", "good", "fair", "poor", 
                        "poor", "good", "good", "fair", "good"))
)

# Try to take the mean of each variable in the data frame
mean(pull(problem1_df, vec_numeric))
mean(pull(problem1_df, vec_logical))
mean(pull(problem1_df, vec_char))
mean(pull(problem1_df, vec_factor))
```

The mean of the numeric vector and the logical vector can be taken from the data frame. However, it doesn't work for the character vector and the factor vector.
